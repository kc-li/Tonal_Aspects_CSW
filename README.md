The three `process_` python scripts show how we process the corpus data. 

The `Stats_report` R file demonstrates the essential statistical results. We recommend download and browse the html directly,as we are unable to share the data files used in R due to restrcted access to the corpus. However, if you obtain the access to the corpus, the data files can be reproduced using the processing python scripts.

There is a poster that showssome preliminary results:
