# Tonal_Aspects_CSW

The files in this repository are supplemental material associated with the paper: Li, Bryant & Nguyen (2023): Lexical tonal effects in code-switching: A comparative study of Cantonese, Mandarin and Vietnamese switching with English. *Submitted for Review.*

The three python scripts with prefix `process_` demonstrate how corpora were processed. 

The R markdown file (and knitted html) `Stats_report` includes essential statistical results. The R markdown file (and knitted html) `Stats_validation` includes the additional validations of model.

To have a quick overview of the html files, you can prepend this fragment to the URL of HTML files: `https://htmlpreview.github.io/?` (See [link](https://github.com/htmlpreview/htmlpreview.github.com))

We are unable to share the raw data files used in analysis due to the restricted access to the corpora. However, if you obtain the access to the corpora, the data files can be reproduced using the processing python scripts. 

There is also a poster that shows some preliminary results at a earlier stage of the study:
